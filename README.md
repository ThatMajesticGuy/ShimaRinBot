# ShimaRinBot
It is a very simple Discord bot I made with python. It wasn't really suppose to be used in other servers, but if you want to use it, go ahead.

# Music
Music commands are a bit wierd. If there is no songs playing at all, you do !play (url), if there is a song playing you will have to do !queue (url) or else it will break, and vise versa. Make sure you also do !join to make the bot join the voice channel
